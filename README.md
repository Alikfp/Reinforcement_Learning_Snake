# Reinforcement_Learning_Snake
### My quest for making an intelligent snake!
The project is inspired by this informative [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org).

However, beware that before starting theis project you need have a solid understanding of 
  1. Reinforcement Learning
  2. Q-learning (a branch of model-free RL)
  3. Deep reinforcement learning
  
You can explore my [blog](https://medium.com/@kafaeialireza) for such contents!

## Training the Snake
Set up your virtual environment, install the dependencies and you then just simply run the agent!\

`python3 run agent.py `

The snake refines its strategy after each round!

**Note:** It is a SLOW learner though, give the poor retarded snake at least 400 rounds to get the hang of the game =/
